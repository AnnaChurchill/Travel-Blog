# Travel-Blog
A blog of our trip around Australia


With this project I hope to advance my abilities in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a user-friendly record of our 2023 trip around Australia. This is purely for personal development and interest.

Vision:
The document should end up with the following layout:
Header bar with title
The rest of the document divided into 3 columns:
LH Column: Name of Place and brief description of our time there
Mid Column: Photos in a tiled layout
RH Column: Comments people have made and text box for people to make new comments

For the photos I aim to:
- Make them slightly larger when hovered over
- Make them available to click on to expand them to the whole screen
- Give them individual descriptions which are displayed when photo is clicked on
- Have arrows to be able to scroll through photos displayed large.

I aim to ideally be able to add photos and descriptions using the website interface (rather than adding them into the HTML/JavaScript document manually).


Status:
Currently I have done courses in HTML and CSS. I have nearly finished completing one in JavaScript. 
I have thus far been working on the general layout and the header bar. I am now working on the best way to do the tiling of the photos. 

The website is not yet in a state to publish, but I hope to publish it to be able to share it with friends and family.
